# AHK Triggerbot Scripts for Valorant

Hey guys,

A while ago, I created some AHK Triggerbot Scripts for Valorant. I modified the initial script named **"UptoDate_Pandx"** and added several features:

- **Presets for different guns**
- **No shooting while moving**
- **Toggle sounds for different configs**


*Maybe I'll add automatic counter-strafing in the future.*

Everything can be configured to your preferences. Have fun using the script!

## Important Instructions

- **Disable "Raw Input Buffer"** in the Valorant General settings tab.

## Responsibility Disclaimer

*Note: You are solely responsible for how you use the triggerbot script.*
